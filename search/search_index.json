The instance we're going to spin up today is intended to host a small number of users, up to about a hundred. If you need to have more users than that, say for a large class, then you can either spin up multiple of these servers or use Kubernetes. Pre-requisites for this Video Access to a Virtual Private Server with Ubuntu 18.04 installed. Have a domain purchased (if you desire https with LetsEncrypt) Ability to create DNS records for your Domain Create a DigitalOcean Droplet Must be Ubuntu 18.04 We're gonna go with the 4GB / 2 CPUs droplet At least 768MB RAM for TLJH to install Use an SSH Key or One Time Password to login, your choice. For sizing your instances, remember Recommended Memory = (Max concurrent users * Max mem per user) + 128MB Recommended CPU = (Max concurrent users * Max CPU usage per user) + 20% Disk space = (Total users * Max disk usage per user) + 2GB Create an A record in DNS for your server. This will ensure we get a certificate from LetsEncrypt and will allow us to navigate to it later. SSH to your droplet and setup proper user accounts. You can follow the tutorial here . Run this code on your machine. This will setup the JupyterHub Server #!/bin/bash wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyterhub/the-littlest-jupyterhub/master/bootstrap/bootstrap.py \\ sudo python3 boostrap.py --admin mason Setup HTTPS for your JupyterHub sudo tljh-config set https.enabled true sudo tljh-config set https.letsencrypt.email mason@digitalocean.com sudo tljh-config add-item https.letsencrypt.domains jupyterhub.egger.codes View the config and confirm your changes are correct. sudo tljh-config show Reload the proxy when you're ready sudo tljh-config reload proxy Potential Issues If your Jupyterhub fails to launch a server when you login simply sudo systemctl restart jupyterhub.service and it should work.
